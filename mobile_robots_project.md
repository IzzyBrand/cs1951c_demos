# cs1951c project: Mobile Robots

## Step 1: Assemble the Robot

We've distributed the kits. Assemble your wheeled robot chassis and wire everything up.

## Step 2: Drive in a square

Program your robot to drive in a square (This may require some tuning!). See the [code example to get started](https://github.com/IzzyBrand/cs1951c_demos/tree/master/L298NExample). You do not need to use any additional sensors for this step. 

What do you think will happen to your square as the battery starts to run low? What if we change the surface that the bot is driving on? Is there any way we could ensure the square is more consistent?

## Step 3: Use a sensor!

Add a sensor to your robot, and come up with an interesting behavior that makes use of a sensor. Mobile robots have significant potential to exhibit very life-like/funny/interesting/complex behavior with a minimal amount of code. Remember the example of a light-seeking robot with just two light sensors and two wheels? Think about how you can incorporate randomness into your !

Some sensor ideas:

 * ultrasonic sensor(s)
 * motion sensor
 * light sensor(s)

See the [code example for ideas](https://github.com/IzzyBrand/cs1951c_demos/tree/master/L298NWheeledRobotExample)

## Step 4: ?????

The sky is the limit! Feel free to build a new chassis for your robot. Change your wheels? Add a body? Make a swarm?

Some things to think about:

 * how will the physical design of your robot work with your code to achieve your goals
 * Your robot is free! make sure it doesn't get lost somewhere
 * If your robot is in a space with people, how will it interact with those people?
